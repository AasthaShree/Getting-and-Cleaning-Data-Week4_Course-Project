Data Description

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz

Activity column has 6 types performed by 30 subjects:

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
Training data-70% of the volunteers
Test data-30% of the volunteers 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).

The sensor acceleration signals, which has gravitational and body motion components,and the sensor gyroscope signal which indicate angular velocity were processed to generate a vector of features  obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. There are total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.
